"""CameraController: handles mouse look smoothing, movement input, and wall blocking.

This isolates input and movement from WorldScene. It reads keys, updates
rotation smoothing toward targets set by mouse deltas, moves the camera via
Camera.move_camera(), and checks world bounds and wall collisions using hooks
on the scene.
