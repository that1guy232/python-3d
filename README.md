# python-3d
3D Python project from local workspace.

Runtime code is split by ownership:

- `src/engine/` contains reusable loop, scene, camera, rendering, collision, UI,
  texture, sound, and engine config code.
- `src/game/` contains the world game, game config, authored content, and asset
  resource catalogs.

## Performance logging

Press F3 while the game is running to toggle performance logging in the console.
Press F4 to reset the current timing window.

You can also start with logging enabled:

```powershell
$env:PY3D_PERF_LOG="1"
py src/main.py
```

Useful knobs:

```powershell
$env:PY3D_PERF_INTERVAL="3.0"  # seconds between reports
$env:PY3D_PERF_TOP="14"        # number of slowest sections to print
$env:PY3D_SETUP_TIMING="1"     # print world-loading setup timings
$env:PY3D_RERAISE_SCENE_EXCEPTIONS="1"  # crash on scene hook failures while debugging
```

## Tests

Run the headless unit tests with:

```powershell
py -m unittest discover -s tests
```

## Declaring world content

Game code can now declare content before the build pipeline turns it into
meshes, collision, lighting, and runtime entities:

```python
from game.world import WorldContent, WorldScene, building

scene = WorldScene(
    world_content=WorldContent.with_buildings(
        [
            building((1200, 0, 900), width=240, depth=180, doorway_side="south"),
        ]
    ),
    defer_setup=True,
)
```
