Press F4 to reset the current timing window.

You can also start with logging enabled:

```powershell
$env:PY3D_PERF_LOG="1"
py src/main.py
```

Useful knobs:

```powershell
$env:PY3D_PERF_INTERVAL="3.0"  # seconds between reports
$env:PY3D_PERF_TOP="14"        # number of slowest sections to print
$env:PY3D_SETUP_TIMING="1"     # print world-loading setup timings
```
